h1. is_rateable

Currently star buttons are a put request, not a post request like they should be due to time constraints. Should be fixed in a future version. 

Patches welcome! I do test my own stuff but until I find a nice and easy way to include rspec in plugins, they won't come with the specs.

h2. Usage

To install, type <code>script/generate rateable [--by_user]</code>

h3. Options

--by-user will associate your ratings to a user model.  Hopefully you've got one already.

h4. Without Ajax
In your model.
<code>
  <pre>
    is_rateable :upto => 5 # it defaults :upto => 5
  </pre>
</code>

In your view.
<code>
  <pre>
    render_rating(@book, :interactive_stars)
    render_rating(@book) # If you want to also see 1/5 Stars
  </pre>
</code>

If a user rates more than twice, it will delete their older rating and put up a new rating.

Add a method to your books_controller like so:
<code>
  <pre>
    def rate
      @book = Book.find(params[:id])
      unless @book.add_rating(params[:rating].to_i, :ip => request.remote_ip)
        flash[:notice] = "You have already voted on this book"
      end
      redirect_to @book
    end
  </pre>
</code>

h4. Using Ajax
You can use the same code for your model
<code>
  <pre>
    is_rateable :upto => 5 # it defaults :upto => 5
  </pre>
</code>

On your view, you need to call a partial
<code>
  <pre>
    #Using html.erb
      <div id="rating">
        <%= render :partial => "books/rate", :locals => { :rateable => @book } %>
      </div>

    #Using haml 
      #rating
        render :partial => "books/rate", :locals => { :rateable => @book }
  </pre>
</code>

Your partial will have a spinner and a div to be replaced when ajax is completed
<code>
  <pre>
    #Using html.erb (views/books/_rate.html.erb)
      <%= render_ajax_rating rateable %>
      <%= image_tag "icons/spinner.gif", :id => :spinner, :style => "display: none;" %>
      <div id="success_rating" style="display:none;">
        Rated!
      </div>

    #Using haml (views/books/_rate.html.haml)

      = render_ajax_rating rateable
      = image_tag "icons/spinner.gif", :id => :spinner, :style => "display: none;"
      #success_rating{:style => "display:none;"}
        Rated!
  </pre>
</code>

On your controller:
<code>
  <pre>
    def rate
        @book = Book.find(params[:id])
        @book.rate params[:rating].to_i
        render :update do |page|
          page.replace_html("rating", {:partial => "rate", :locals => {:rateable => @book}})
          page.show "success_rating"
        end
    end
  </pre>
</code>
